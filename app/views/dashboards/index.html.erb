                          If you're working on a server, please complete the "servers" tab of the Sprint 3 Spreadsheet. This time around you'll need to update the status flag to indicate whether you've begun work (or completed work), so clients will know when to start testing. You'll also share details about how a developer can obtain OAuth client credentials (client_id for public apps, or a client_id and client_secret for confidential apps) as well as user login credentials. You might consider simply sharing a set of fixed credentials in this spreadsheet, or else directing users to a web page where they can complete self-service registration. If absolutely necessary, you can ask developers to e-mail you directly.

                          <p>This sprint builds on our introduction to the SMART on FHIR OAuth 2.0 authorization process. Recall that in Sprint 2, we authorized access at a very coarse level, delegating all of a user's read privileges to an app. This time, we add support for apps that don't need access to an entire population of patient records, but instead require just one record. We accomplish this through a set of "launch scopes". In terms of SMART's authorization guide, we'll make the following assumptions:
                          &nbsp;Standalone launch sequence only
                          Public clients and confidential clients are both supported
                          Access scopes include:
                          launch/patient (indicates to the EHR that a single patient must be selected to complete the launch process)
                          patient/*.read (to ensure a patient-specific access token)
                          Onecontext parameter is returned to the app upon successful authorization:
                          &nbsp; - patient (indicates the patient currently open in the EHR)
                          &nbsp; - No single-sign-on (OpenID Connect) is required</p>
